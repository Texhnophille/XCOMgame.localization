DescriptionEntry="В A Better Barracks есть восемь обучаемых классов для XCOM. У них есть некоторые общие атрибуты и механики: \n\nОсновное оружие: Каждый класс имеет доступ к двум видам основного оружия, один из которых они могут свободно выбрать. Они могут использовать одно основное лёгкое (автомат или дробовик) и одно основное тяжёлое (пушка или снайперская винтовка).\n\nДополнительное оружие: Каждый класс имеет доступ к одному дополнительному оружию. Дополнительное оружие уникально для каждого конкретного класса.\n\nРулетка способностей: Все классы в ABB подвержены рулетке способностей, которая рандомизирует их древо способностей с помощью запаса, состоящего из классовых способностей и общих способностей.\n\nХотите узнать больше?\nИсследуйте Станцию Связи Сопротивления, чтобы разблокировать детальную информацию о классах XCOM и узнать, как они изменились в ABB.

ListTitle="Рулетка Способностей"
DescriptionTitle="Рулетка Способностей"
DescriptionEntry="Древа способностей для всех солдат XCOM рандомизированы. Каждый солдат имеет четыре ветви способностей: одна имеет название класса, две называются "Оперативник", а одна называется XCOM.\n\nКлассовые Способности\nКлассовые способности определяют роль классов. Любые способности, относящиеся к дополнительному оружию, являются необходимыми классовыми способностями. Всего классовых способностей приблизительно вдвое больше количества рангов, поэтому вероятность появления каждой способности - около 50%.\n\nСпособности ветвей "Оперативник"\nВторая и третья ветви способностей взяты из запасов способностей категории "Оперативник". Эта категория состоит из способностей, которые могут появиться у большинства классов. Многие классовые способности также появляются в качестве способностей ветвей "Оперативник" для других классов. Поскольку категория "Оперативник" состоит из гораздо большего количества способностей, чем классовая категория, шансы появления конкретной способности гораздо ниже. К примеру, Лазутчик - это классовая способность Агентов. Другие классы могут получить эту способность в ветках "Оперативник", но с куда меньшей вероятностью.\n\nСпособности XCOM\nМеханика и запасы способностей для XCOM никак не изменились по сравнению с базовой игрой.\n\nВсе способности, привязанные как к классу, так и к категории "Оперативник" также разделены на уровни, что позволяет держать разнообразие рандомизированного древа способностей под контролем."

Spray shots are subject to an aim penalty of -20, but they allow to leverage the ammo pool of the weapon to the fullest.\nEnvironmental damage: Cannons deal increased damage to environmental objects, tearing down cover and walls on misses. This means that even a missed Spray shot can have a positive effect.\nSpecial Range: Cannons follow a unique range table that offers a smaller bonus to aim at its peak than medium and short range tables, but over a wider area of distances. They have a sweet spot at a range of 11 tiles where the aim bonus is highest and then fall off in both directions slowly. This never turns into an aim penalty. In practice, this means that a soldier with a cannon does not need to change his position often. He can entrench somewhere with good line of sight, preferably on high ground, and then cover a large area from there.\n\nNote that the upgrade to tier 2 weapon tech will give a modslot to this weapon.\n\n"

DescriptionEntry="Name: ADVENT Flammenwerfer\nClassification: Light Primary Weapon\n\nThe ADVENT Flammenwerfer is a strange hybrid weapon, probably intended to be as intimidating as it is deadly. Powered by an internal fuel tank, the Flammenwerfer is a combination of a shotgun-like close quarters weapon and a flame thrower. We think that the design for this weapon was initially discarded due to impractibility in everyday scenarios, but dredged up again due to the increasingly prominent situation with The Lost.\n\nConventional Flammenwerfer\nDamage: 2-4\nCrit Damage: 1\nPierce: 0\nShred: 1\nAmmo: 12\nRange: short\nModslots: 0\nActions to fire: 1\nActions to reload: no reload\nAbilities provided: Flamethrower, fire damage, internal fuel tank\n\nFlamethrower: Torch an area in front of you, starting fires and burn anything caught in the blast. Unlike the Purifier's flamethrower weapons, the Flammenwerfer deals full damage even in flamethrower mode. Costs 3 ammo.\nFire Damage: Any damage dealt by this weapon, including the primary shot, deals 100% fire damage. This means that it can not harm immune enemies like MECs and Purifiers. However, it also means that it will ignite everything else, which will deal damage over time.\nInternal fuel tank: The fuel tank allows for a large number of shots before reloading, however it can not be refilled or swapped out on mission. The ammo that the weapon starts with will have to suffice. As a silver lining, Flammenwerfers are immune to the weapon disabling effect of Codex Psi Bombs because of this.\n\nNote that the Flammenwerfer is not able to use weapon modifications at all.\n\nAll ADVENT weapons need to be found in the field.

[ITFragments X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Weapon Fragments"
DescriptionTitle="Weapon Fragments"
DescriptionEntry="Weapon Fragments represent bits and pieces of broken or otherwise unusable alien equipment collected in the field. They are used in large quantities to upgrade existing weapon technologies. Some items and weapons that are individually built also require fragments to build. Keeping healthy stockpiles of these should be a priority for the Commander if he wants to keep his weapon tech up to date.\nThere are four distinct types of fragments: Light and Heavy Weapon Fragments for the development of primary weapons; Tech and Sidearm Fragments for the development of secondary weapons. As a general rule of thumb, light fragments are more common than heavy ones and sidearm fragments are more common than tech fragments. You can gain these items in the following ways:\n\nFrom enemy corpses\nMany enemies, but especially ADVENT, drop some type of fragment on death. This drop is tied to their corpse which means you will only get the fragments on missions where the corpses are recovered. For most enemies, fragment drops are heavily weighted towards one or two types. As examples, Purifiers will likely drop heavy fragments, Lancers will likely drop sidearm or light fragments and MECs will likely drop heavy or tech fragments. An enemy that drops fragments will always have a 10% chance to drop an untypical type of fragment, so you are able to get anything over time no matter what enemies you face.\n\nFrom enemy loot\nIf an enemy drops timed loot, there is a small chance that a large amount of appropriate fragments is added to the drop, resulting in a very noticable loot fountain. Pick these up whenever possible.\n\nFrom the black market\nThe Black Market will have a stack of fragments for sale each month. Depending on size and type, it can be very much worth the intel cost to pick these up. Note that there will be no fragments for sale if the Black Market is instead looking to buy fragments from you.\n\nFrom dismantling weapons\nThe special ADVENT weapons that can be found on missions can be dismantled in the lab if they are no longer needed. This will yield 10-20 heavy or light fragments, depending on the type and tier of the weapon." 

[ITComponents X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Upgrade Components"
DescriptionTitle="Upgrade Components"
DescriptionEntry="Upgrade Components represent alien technology that XCOM can not replicate for the use in weapons and equipment - things like alien energy cells, plasma conduits and the like. Like Elerium Cores, Upgrade Components exist only in limited quantities, which makes them a major limiting factor when developint new tech. The lack of these components will often force the Commander to prioritize because he won't be able to order all the upgrades at once. There are two tiers of components, named after the technological tier that can be achieved by using them. Ways to get Upgrade Components:\n\nFrom enemy corpses\nMost alien enemies are able to drop a component on death. This drop is tied to their corpse which means you will only get the item on missions where the corpses are recovered. The type of component dropped depends on the enemy, of course. A Sectoid is only able to drop tier 2 components, while a Gatekeeper will always drop tier 3. The first alien able to drop tier 3 components is the Muton.\n\nFrom enemy loot\nIf an enemy drops timed loot, there is a small chance that a component or two are added.\n\nFrom the black market\nThe Black Market will have a stack of 1 to 3 components for sale each month. Depending on size and type, it can be very much worth the intel cost to pick these up. Note that there will be no components for sale if the Black Market is instead looking to buy them from you.\n\nFrom dismantling weapons\nThe special ADVENT weapons that can be found on missions can be dismantled in the lab if they are no longer needed. This will yield a component equal to the tier of the weapon that was dismantled.\n\nFrom Elerium Cores\nIn a pinch, Tygan can create substitutes for components by dismantling an Elerium Core. One Core dismantles into two components of your choice."

[ITAttachments X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Attachments"
DescriptionTitle="Attachments"
DescriptionEntry="Some of the weapon attachments have new effects. Anything not mentioned here works like in the unmodded version.\n\nRepeaters -> Compensators\nThe execution mechanic is completely gone from Repeaters. Instead, they are replaced with a bonus to critical damage. This still acts as a way to give weapons a random chance to have higher impact, but without being completely binary and out of the players control. To indicate this complete change in functionality, they have been renamed to Compensators.\n\nScopes\nA Better Barracks removes most unconditional aim bonuses from the game and replaces them with mechanics that are more interactive. The aim bonus is completely removed from scopes, now the Stock has something to increase aim. Instead, the Scope offers bonuses to armor pierce and prevents the enemy from dodging. To indicate this, it has been renamed to Penetrator Scope.\n\nStock\nAgain, the old mechanic is completely removed and replaced by something else. In this case, the Stock now provides the means to increase soldier aim. It does this by giving access to the Stabilize and Fire perk, which gets an aim bonus of +5 per tier of the stock, but does require 2 actions. As a result, the Stock is of particular use to cannons and sniper rifles which already use two actions to fire. This also means that the aim bonus will not apply to any special shots like Chainshot or Saturation Fire.\nTo indicate these modifications, the name has been changed to Marksman's Stock.\n\nAutoloaders\nOn rifles, sniper rifles and cannons, the Autoloader behaves exactly like in the unmodded game, providing free reloads that don't cost an action. For shotguns, they now have a special behavior. Autoloaders on shotguns provide the Full Reload ability, which allows to fully reload the weapon for two actions, thus bypassing the Single Reload drawback at the cost of an attachment slot. This doesn't use charges and is not influenced by the tier of the attachment at all."

The soldier carrying the Traumakit can not heal himself with it. Unlike the standard Medkit heal, Medic Sprint does end the turn.\nImmunities: Traumakits offer immunity to poison.\nStabilize: Stabilize an adjacent soldier who is currently bleeding out, just like with the basic Medkit.\nRevive: Traumakits can be used to put unconscious soldiers back on their feet.\n\nTraumakits can be upgraded to Nanotraumakits with the Battlefield Medicine project.\n\nSpecialists will overwrite Medic Sprint with their Medical Protocol perk if they have it.
